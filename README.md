# Course Dependency Visualization Tool

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing course dependencies and prerequisites for mathematics and physics majors at Tel Aviv University. This project provides a graph representation of course relationships, helping students better understand course progression paths.

## Features

- Interactive graph visualization of course dependencies
- Dynamic prerequisite path highlighting
- Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities:
  - Filter by faculty (Mathematics/Physics)
  - Filter by course type (Lectures, Seminars, etc.)
  - Filter by evaluation method
  - Filter by academic year
- Grade visualization:
  - Color-coded courses based on average grades
  - Historical grade data and grade distribution histograms
- Visual indicators for course availability and prerequisites
- Direct access to course syllabi

## Usage

1. Open [`course_graph.html`](https://tom-bleher.github.io/Coursesearch/course_graph.html) in your web browser.
2. Interaction features:
   - Click a course to expand/collapse its dependencies
   - Use the search bar to find specific courses
   - Apply filters using the sidebar controls
